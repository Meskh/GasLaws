# Gas Laws Educational Website

An interactive educational website about the three fundamental gas laws, developed as my AQA Computer Science NEA (Non-Exam Assessment). This site explains and visualizes Boyle’s, Charles’s, and Gay-Lussac’s laws for students in a clear and interactive way.

## About

As part of my AQA Computer Science NEA project, I built this website to help learners understand how ideal gas properties (pressure, volume, and temperature) are related to one another. Interactive simulations and clear diagrams allow users to:

- **Visualize** how changing one variable affects the others
- ![SimulationDemo](./DemoPics/P6)
- **Gas simulation** with real-time sliders
- ![SimulationDemo](./DemoPics/P2)
- **Read** concise theory sections with worked examples

## Features

- **Interactive Simulations** for Boyle’s, Charles’s, and Gay-Lussac’s laws
- **Dynamic Graphs** plotting P-V or V-T relationships
- **Theory Pages** with definitions, formulas, and example problems  
- **Navigation Menu** for quick access to each law

## Usage

- Use the sliders on each law’s page to adjust variables.  
- Watch the graph update in real time.  
- Consult the “Theory” section for formulas and explanations.
